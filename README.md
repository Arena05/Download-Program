# Download Program 
Although there are websites on the Internet to download videos from YouTube, they are usually loaded with ads and sometimes you can not download the videos you want.
In this situation I decided to create a simple program to download videos and music from YouTube. 
The code is very basic so you can use it to learn or if you are more experienced make suggestions to improve it.

## Steps to start using it
- You will need to first download the zipped file or clone it into a folder.
```
git clone https://github.com/Arena05/Download-Program.git
```
- Then you will need to install the libraries found in the header of the code.
```
pip install customtkinter
pip install pytube
```
- Finally you run the `Download.py` file
